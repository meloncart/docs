Each order captures a snapshot of the purchased items, pricing, customer addresses, payment and shipping selections, and tax calculations. Navigate to <strong>Shop → Orders</strong> to manage your orders.</p><h2 id="order-list" tabindex="-1">Order List <a class="header-anchor" href="#order-list" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Order List&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The order list displays all orders with their key details: order number, customer name, status, total, and date. The list supports several features for efficient order management:</p><h3 id="status-tab-filters" tabindex="-1">Status Tab Filters <a class="header-anchor" href="#status-tab-filters" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Status Tab Filters&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The order list includes tabs across the top that filter orders by status. Click a status tab to show only orders in that status. This makes it easy to focus on orders that need attention — for example, viewing only new orders that need processing or paid orders that need fulfillment.</p><h3 id="searching-and-filtering" tabindex="-1">Searching and Filtering <a class="header-anchor" href="#searching-and-filtering" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Searching and Filtering&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Use the search bar to find orders by order number, customer name, or email address.

When orders have different current statuses, only transitions that are valid for all selected orders are available.</li></ul><h3 id="import-and-export" tabindex="-1">Import and Export <a class="header-anchor" href="#import-and-export" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Import and Export&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Use the <strong>Import</strong> and <strong>Export</strong> buttons on the order list toolbar to work with orders in CSV format.

Each item displays its full description including variant information and any bundle components.</p><p>You can manage order items directly:</p><ul><li><strong>Add Item</strong> — Click to add a new product to the order.

Also includes email and phone number.</li><li><strong>Shipping Address</strong> — The delivery destination, with the same fields as the billing address.</li></ul><p>A <strong>Copy Billing Address</strong> button copies the billing address to the shipping address fields.

Each transition specifies:</p><ul><li><strong>From Status</strong> — The starting status.</li><li><strong>To Status</strong> — The destination status.</li><li><strong>Admin Group</strong> — The backend user group allowed to make this transition.</li></ul><p>For example, you might allow your &quot;Warehouse&quot; admin group to transition orders from &quot;Processing&quot; to &quot;Shipped&quot;, but only allow &quot;Managers&quot; to transition orders to &quot;Cancelled&quot;.</p><p>When a backend user views an order, the status dropdown only shows transitions that are valid for the order&#39;s current status and the user&#39;s admin group membership.</p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p><p>If no transitions are defined for a status, backend users with access to that status can transition to any other status.

An invoice is generated in the payment system.</li><li><strong>Payment is processed</strong> — When the payment gateway confirms payment, the order status automatically transitions to &quot;Paid&quot;. Stock levels are decreased for all items in the order.</li><li><strong>Order is fulfilled</strong> — A backend user processes the order, picks and packs the items, and updates the status (e.g., to &quot;Processing&quot; or &quot;Shipped&quot;).
