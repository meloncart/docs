You can search and filter to find specific customers.</p><p>Click a customer to view their full profile, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Name and email</strong> — The customer&#39;s display name and login email address.</li><li><strong>Profile fields</strong> — Extended profile information such as phone number, company name, and address details (provided by the RainLab.UserPlus plugin).</li><li><strong>Status</strong> — Whether the account is activated, banned, or pending verification.</li></ul><h2 id="customer-order-history" tabindex="-1">Customer Order History <a class="header-anchor" href="#customer-order-history" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Customer Order History&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When viewing a customer&#39;s profile, an <strong>Orders</strong> tab displays all orders placed by that customer, with the most recent orders shown first. This gives you a complete purchase history for each customer, which is useful for support inquiries and understanding buying patterns.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>The Orders tab is added to the user profile automatically by Meloncart.

This safeguard ensures that order records maintain their customer reference for accounting and reporting purposes.</p><p>If you need to deactivate a customer who has placed orders, use the <strong>Ban</strong> feature instead of deleting. Banned customers cannot log in or place new orders, but their account and order history are preserved.</p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p><p>Attempting to delete a customer who has placed orders will result in an error.
