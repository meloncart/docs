If a product comes in multiple sizes and colors, each size-color pair (e.g., &quot;Large / Red&quot;) is a variant. Each variant can have its own price, SKU, weight, dimensions, and stock level, allowing you to manage each combination independently.</p><h2 id="when-to-use-variants" tabindex="-1">When to Use Variants <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-to-use-variants" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;When to Use Variants&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Use variants when you need per-combination control over pricing or inventory. For example:</p><ul><li>A t-shirt in sizes S, M, L and colors Red, Blue — where &quot;Large / Red&quot; has a different price than &quot;Small / Blue&quot;.</li><li>A laptop with storage options 256GB and 512GB — where each option has a different SKU and stock count.</li><li>A ring in sizes 5–10 — where each size has a unique barcode.</li></ul><p>If all combinations share the same price, SKU, and stock level, you may only need <a href="./products.html#product-options">product options</a> without variants.</p><h2 id="enabling-variants" tabindex="-1">Enabling Variants <a class="header-anchor" href="#enabling-variants" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Enabling Variants&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Variants are available when the product type has the <strong>Has Variants</strong> feature enabled. On the product form, check the <strong>Use Variants</strong> checkbox to activate variant management for that product.</p><p>Once enabled, a <strong>Variants</strong> tab appears on the product form where you can generate and manage individual variants.</p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p><p>Before generating variants, make sure you have defined your product options (e.g., Size and Color with their values) on the <strong>Options</strong> tab. Variants are created from the combinations of these option values.</p></div><h2 id="generating-variants" tabindex="-1">Generating Variants <a class="header-anchor" href="#generating-variants" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Generating Variants&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Click the <strong>Generate Variants</strong> button to automatically create a variant for every possible combination of your product options. This produces the full Cartesian product of all option values.</p><p>For example, if your product has:</p><ul><li><strong>Size</strong>: Small, Medium, Large</li><li><strong>Color</strong>: Red, Blue</li></ul><p>Generating variants creates six variants: Small/Red, Small/Blue, Medium/Red, Medium/Blue, Large/Red, Large/Blue.</p><p>Only new combinations are created — if some variants already exist, they are left unchanged. This means you can safely regenerate after adding new option values without losing existing variant data.</p><h2 id="managing-variants" tabindex="-1">Managing Variants <a class="header-anchor" href="#managing-variants" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Managing Variants&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Each variant appears as a row in the variants list. Click a variant to edit its attributes:</p><ul><li><strong>SKU</strong> — A unique SKU for this specific variant. If left empty, the product&#39;s base SKU is used.</li><li><strong>Price</strong> — A variant-specific price. If left empty, the product&#39;s base price is used.</li><li><strong>Cost</strong> — The cost price for this variant.</li><li><strong>Compare Price</strong> — An optional comparison price displayed alongside the variant price.</li><li><strong>Weight</strong> — The shipping weight for this variant. Falls back to the product&#39;s weight if empty.</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong> (Width, Height, Depth) — Physical dimensions for this variant. Falls back to the product&#39;s dimensions if empty.</li><li><strong>Barcode</strong> — An optional barcode (UPC, EAN, etc.) for this variant.</li><li><strong>Units in Stock</strong> — The stock level for this variant. See <a href="./inventory.html">Inventory</a> for details.</li><li><strong>Stock Alert Threshold</strong> — The stock level at which a low-stock alert is triggered.</li><li><strong>Enabled</strong> — Whether this variant is available for purchase.

Set the <strong>Units in Stock</strong> field on a variant to manage its stock level separately from the product.</p><p>If a variant&#39;s stock field is left empty, stock tracking falls back to the product level. This lets you choose between product-level and variant-level inventory tracking on a per-variant basis.</p><p>For more details on inventory management, see the <a href="./inventory.html">Inventory</a> documentation.</p><h2 id="how-variant-resolution-works" tabindex="-1">How Variant Resolution Works <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-variant-resolution-works" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How Variant Resolution Works&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When a customer selects options on the product page and adds the product to the cart, the system identifies the correct variant by computing a hash from the selected option combination.
