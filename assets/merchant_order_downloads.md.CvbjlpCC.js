There is no way to access files from other products.</li><li><strong>No authentication required</strong> — Download links work without requiring the customer to be logged in, making them easy to share via email or order confirmation pages.</li></ul><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>For best results, upload your digital products as ZIP archives.
